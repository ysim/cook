# cook

**UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK!**

With this program, you can keep recipes in the form of Markdown files, render
recipes to the command line, and search through arbitrary user-defined fields
in the front matter, such as `tags: [vegetarian, spicy]` or
`ingredients: [salmon]`.

This program was inspired by Jason A. Donenfeld's
[pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/).

# cook

**UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT.**

With this program, you can keep recipes in the form of Markdown files and
search through arbitrary user-defined fields in the front matter and/or in the
recipe Markdown itself.

This program was inspired by Jason A. Donenfeld's
[pass](https://www.passwordstore.org/).
